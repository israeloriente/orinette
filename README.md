<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

I decided to create this automated evaluation example to make the work more proactive. This script does not know what the "Molinette" standards are and can get some exercises wrong. Most of the exercises will only correct simple spelling errors and convert output data...

YOU SHOULD BE WISE, DON'T GET COMPLACENT WITH THIS TOOL BUT EXPLORE THE DOUBTS OF YOUR COLLEAGUE AND LEARN IN THIS TIME THAT HAS BEEN GAINED.

### Built With NodeJS

I am not an expert on the subject, in fact I created this in a few days watching youtube videos and basic javascript "hello world" tutorials, I tried to apply the concepts learned in shell00 and pass the data a validation in a higher level language.
Below are some things I needed to read to make the thing work:

* [NODEJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com)
* [JAVASCRIPT](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

I will try to explain every step of how to evaluate your candidates with just a few commands in the installation part.

### Prerequisites

You don't need any requirements, but your machine must have the "node" program installed as administrator.
Check if you already have it on your machine with:
* nodeJS
  ```sh
  node -v && npm -v
  ```
or

* [Download NODEJS](https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.17.3/node-v14.17.3.pkg)


### Installation

1. The first step is to clone my project:
   ```sh
   cd ~  && git clone https://github.com/israeloriente/orinette.git orinette
   ```
   If everything works correctly you will receive this:
      
   <img width="480" alt="Screen Shot 2021-07-13 at 4 08 55 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31784632/125477079-e6da8f71-66e0-4fd1-8e32-1399e723ff6e.png">

      
2. Install NPM packages
   We need to do this to download some packages that are not yet in the project, do it:
   ```sh
   cd orinette && npm install
   ```
   If everything works correctly you will receive this:
   
   <img width="335" alt="Screen Shot 2021-07-13 at 4 11 12 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31784632/125477188-03b13355-c485-47bd-8692-cb5132003dac.png">

Can't do it or did you find an error?
Help me by creating an issue!

* [Open Issue](https://github.com/israeloriente/orinette/issues/new)

Now your environment already has everything we need, in the next step we will see how to use it with your data.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Let's say you are evaluating someone from exercise C01, the first thing to do is to clone their repository. Let's do this:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31784632/125480660-4134cf79-089b-412a-95bd-2c54fbdb59b3.mov

Let's go inside folder c01 because someone did the work of c01, so do it:

```sh
   cd c01
```

The only file you need to modify is "dataCXX.js".
 this is where you can put the values that will be tested and the name of the person you want to evaluate.
 Below is a clone of "someone" but you can clone as many projects as you want from various people to do dynamic testing. Any other file in this folder you don't need to modify, just ignore it:
 
 <img width="237" alt="Screen Shot 2021-07-13 at 4 39 28 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31784632/125482763-14e389e5-4056-4897-be68-7e9a363d5247.png">
 
 After changing the name in the "data" file just run the command "node testCXX.ts" which in this case is ex01:
 
 ```sh
 node testC01.ts
 ```
